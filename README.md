# Farmkart
> Greetings! I am thrilled to introduce you to my FarmKart project, a web-based e-commerce platform developed during my third semester. This project, powered by Django and styled with Tailwind CSS, utilizes an SQLite3 database to connect farmers with customers, simplifying the process of selling farm products directly to consumers.

## Project Overview:
> FarmKart is a user-friendly e-commerce website designed to bridge the gap between farmers and consumers. It provides a digital marketplace where farmers can list and sell their fresh produce and agricultural products directly to customers. By eliminating intermediaries, FarmKart aims to empower farmers, provide consumers with high-quality farm-fresh products, and promote sustainable agriculture.

### Key Features:

- E-commerce Platform: FarmKart offers a fully functional e-commerce platform with features such as product listings, shopping cart, secure payment processing, and order tracking.

- Tailwind CSS Styling: The project's user interface is enriched with the elegant and responsive design elements of Tailwind CSS, ensuring a seamless and visually appealing user experience.

- SQLite3 Database: The use of an SQLite3 database ensures data integrity and efficiency while keeping the project lightweight and easily deployable.
